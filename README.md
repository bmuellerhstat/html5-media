# HTML5 Media
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using_ `<audio>` _and_ `<video>` _elements._

## Before you begin
Observe the files in this repo:  

* `README.md` is the file you're reading.  You should be reading it on GitHub.
* `birds.mp3` is the audio file that you will use.
* `hans-rosling.jpg` is the image you will be using as the poster for the video.
* `index.html` is where you will be doing your coding.
* `result.png` is the result you should be aiming for with `index.html`.
* `stats.mp4` is the video file you will be using.

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repo.
* Add the proper `<audio>` element to `index.html`.
  * The audio should be `birds.mp3`.
  * There should be controls.
  * _If the user's browser does not support HTML5 audio, that message should display_
* Add the proper `<video>` element to `index.html`.
  * The video should be `stats.mp4`.
  * There should be controls.
  * The poster should be `hans-rosling.jpg`.
  * _If the user's browser does not support HTML5 video, that message should display_
* When you are finished, the preview should look like `result.png`.
* Beautify your code so that you can easily see which elements are _inside_ of others (very helpful for debugging `div`s).  
  * _NOTE: the cloud9 keyboard shortcut is_ `âŒ˜+shift+B`
* After you push your changes, set gh-pages to use the **master** branch and use the URL to check that it worked!

Good luck!
